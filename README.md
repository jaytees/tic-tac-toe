# Tic - Tac - Toe

**Overview**

* Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase.
* Use the past 2 weeks programming skills to map out the game logic.
* Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
* Build the application to the spec provided.
* A dynamic game that allows two players to compete.
Craft a README.md file that explains your app to the world.

*and finally...*

**have some fun with it!!**

**Technical Requirements**

The app must;

* Render a game board in the browser
* Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select); your game should prevent users from playing a turn into a square that is already occupied
* Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use Javascript with jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
